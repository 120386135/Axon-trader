This is a sample application to demonstrate the possibilities of the Axon framework in a high load environment. We
have chosen to create a Trader application. All you need to run it is java, mongodb and maven.

Initial setup
-------------
- Make sure you have java installed
http://www.java.com/download/

- Make sure you have maven installed
http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation

- Make sure you have mongodb installed
http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart

When using mongodb in a test environment, it is easiest to just start one instance with the default port on your local machine. If you want another setup, you can find more information in the advanced configuration section.

Running the sample
------------------
- First you need to download the source code, if you are reading this file you already have downloaded the source code, or you are on the main page of the Github project. In the later case, you can easily find a url to clone the repository or to download a zip with all the sources.

* Maven
- Make sure you have your mongo instance running
- Step into the main folder of the project
> mvn clean install
> cd web-ui
> mvn jetty:run-war
- Browse to : http://localhost:8080/

Advanced configuration
----------------------
To write when done :-)


Note to myself
----------------------
Should the ID of the transaction be the same are the ID of the order? Is that possible? There should most probably
be a relation between the two. Think about this, since that would cross aggregate boundaries, which is not allowed.
Think more about the domain concepts around this.
